# SocketIO-ChatApp
Commit on 06 March 2019 at 10:38 with the foloowing notes: These are what came about from the tutorial on building a socket app. Moving forward I am looking to improve the application by adding functionalities for: 
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Add support for nicknames.
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- Show who’s online.
- Add private messaging.
